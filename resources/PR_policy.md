# Things you need to do to get your PR merged:

1. **Make sure you have cited the toolbox paper in your camera-ready version.** For example, "All models are deployed with PyCIL~\cite{zhou2023pycil}". **Include the link to the paper in the pull request description.**
2. Make sure you understand the code structure and the training process defined in the toolbox. **All new methods should inherit from the base class in base.py.**
3. **Do not modify the readme file in your PR.** We will update the readme file after your PR is merged.
4. **Raise a pull request.** We will review your code and merge it if it meets the requirements. The code review process may take some time. Please be patient and do not urge the reviewers.
5. Send an email to the authors of the toolbox to inform them of your PR. **Include your name, position, affiliation, and the title of the paper you are submitting.**
